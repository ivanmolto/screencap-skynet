# SCREEN CAPTURE SKYNET
A Python application that publishes a desktop screenshot to Skynet and gets a skylink to share.
Inspired by [ipfs-screencap](https://github.com/jbenet/ipfs-screencap) from [awesome-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs).

## Setup
You must install the following packages:
- siaskynet
- pyscreenshot


## Usage
In your terminal run the following command:`

`python3 screenshoter.py`

The application will generate a screenshot of the desktop which will be saved locally. 
It will be published to Skynet and you will also get a skylink that you can share with everyone.
